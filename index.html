        <p>SparcElectric is an imaginary energy company.</p> 
        <br>
        <p>This is a preliminary setup of data for a mixed-use data warehouse combining
            OLTP properties with data warehouse capabilities.
            The generated portions follow the fleet operations for the company, mainly
            work orders, on both customer accounts and the company's electric infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>Additional pieces will be added in future, such as meters and grid storage,
             as well as adjustments to the balance of the fleet portions.
